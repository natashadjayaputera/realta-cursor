# Plan Generation Rules

**Location:** `./plan/`  
**Format:** Markdown  
**Filename Pattern:** `{timestamp}_{agent}_plan.md`

---

## Instructions
MANDATORY: All plans generated by any agent MUST be written to the `/plan/` directory.  
The file must be in Markdown format, with the following structure:

- # Title: <Agent> Plan
- ## Objective
- ## Steps
- ## Risks / Constraints
- ## Validation Checklist

---

## Enforcement Rules
- NEVER use `create_plan` tool — always write directly to `/plan/` directory.
- ALWAYS create plan file **BEFORE** starting any migration work.
- Use timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_AgentName_plan.md`.
- Include all required sections in exact order specified.
