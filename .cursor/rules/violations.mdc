# RESPONSE FORMAT WHEN VIOLATION FOUND

**Example:**

```
VIOLATION DETECTED: Rule #5 - Variable Naming

Your code uses:
  private string _CompanyId;  ← CamelCase with underscore

Correct pattern:
  private string _companyId;  ← snake_case after underscore

Fix required: Change to snake_case for all private fields.
Continuing... [or] Stopping work until corrected.
```
